Each .txt file is a project that we want to work on in the hackerspace.

The files try to follow the to-do.txt syntax if it is convenient to the information we have on each project.

The proposed minimum information set is:

-project name
-project description
-project inspiration/theorethical framework/web links
-status
-to do items

this structure will not be enforced.

Pretty much, this is an idea dump
